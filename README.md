# ADC Driver Development - Learning Project

This repository documents my journey of understanding ADCs (Analog to Digital Converters) and developing a register-level ADC driver, starting from theory to hardware-level implementation.

## Objectives

- Build strong understanding of ADC principles  
- Master low-level, bare-metal driver development for STM32 microcontrollers  
- Track technical challenges, solutions, and growth along the journey  

## Project Phases

1. C Fundamentals for Embedded Systems  
2. ADC Theory & Architecture Study  
3. STM32 ADC Register Exploration  
4. ADC Driver Implementation (Polling and Interrupt-based)  
5. Testing, Debugging, and Documentation
